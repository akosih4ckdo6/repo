			<p><b>Algebraic equation</b>, statement of the equality of two expressions formulated by applying to <br>
				a set of variables the algebraic operations, namely, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, <br>
				raising to a power, and extraction of a root. Examples are <i>x<sup>3</sup></i> + 1 and (<i>y<sup>4</sup>x<sup>2</sup></i>+2<i>xy-y</i>)/(<i>x</i>-1) = 12. <br>
				An important special case of such equation is that of polynomial equation, expression of the <br>
				form <i>axn + bxn<sup>-1</sup> + ... + gx + h = k</i>. They have as many solution as their degree (<i>n</i>). and the <br>
				trigonometric function, are said to be transcendental.</p><br>

				<p>A chemical compound is a chemical substance consisting of two or more different chemically<br>
				bonded chemical elements, with a fixed ratio determining the composition.<br><br>
				The ratio of each element is usually expressed by chemical formula.<br><br>
				For example, water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is a compound consisting of two hydrongen atoms bonded to an oxygen <br>
				atom. <br><br>
				the atom within a compound can be held together by a variety of interaction, ranging from <br>
				covalents bonds to electrostatic forces in ionic bonds. <br><br>
				A continuum of bond polarities exist between the purely covalent bond (as in H2) and ionic bonds. <br>
				for example H<sub>2</sub>O is held by polar cavalent bonds. <br><br>
				Sodium chloride is an example of an ionic compound.
